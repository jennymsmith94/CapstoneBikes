# CapstoneBikes
This repository contains the code I used to complete my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate on Coursera. The purpose
was to compare behaviors of casual users and annual members of a bikeshare company, which in turn would support future marketing campaigns
to convert casual users into members. The provided datasets contained information about individual rides that were taken in 1 city over the 
course of 12 months. Ride datetime, start and end location, bike type, and whether the user was a member or not were the main data provided.

The repository contains:
  1. R script I used to import, merge, clean, and analyze the several .csv files that comprised the dataset.
  2. A PowerPoint presentation that I'd give to stakeholders showing the results of my analysis. This includes data visualizations I  
    made using Tableau Public, as well as my recommendations for future use of this data in marketing.

All of the code, visualizations and presentations contained in this repository are my own work. Please do not copy or plagiarize my work.
